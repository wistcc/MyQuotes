My Quotes
========

A Chrome extensions developed to explain how to create a Chrome extension. [Here](http://atlas.com.do/blog/?p=113) you can see my post.

With this extension you will be able to save your favorite quotes while surfing on the internet (just with a right click), see the list of your saved quotes clicking the extension icon, delete quotes from the option page, see a random quote (from your saved list) when you open a new tab, get a notification when a quote has been saved and see a badge on the extensionâ€™s icon with the amount of quotes saved.

Collaborate to make this extension more useful!
